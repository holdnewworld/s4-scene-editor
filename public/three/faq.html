<h1>About the S4F Scene Editor</h1>
<h3>What is this site?</h3>
<p>
 This is just a fun experiment I used to learn a little ThreeJS, AngularJS, and the Ace  code editor.  I hope it's a fun experiment for you to play around with some 3D graphics.
</p>
<h3>Why doesn't it support Safari/IOS?</h3>
<p>
 This site uses ThreeJS and WebGL, and while there is some polyfill support for it on Safari and IOS, it is limited, so I'm not supporting it for now
</p>

<h3>Why not use an existing file format, such as X3D or Collada, instead of inventing S4F?</h3>
<p>
  I wanted to create something from scratch just for fun, and I wanted it to be very simple for demo purposes.
